<!-- Here comes the table of content -->

<!-- Example of paragraph of text with line break -->
Table of content

- [Links and images](#links-and-images)
  - [Links](#links)
  - [Images](#images)


This is example of text with line break.  
This is the break.

This is second sentence on this excerise (from another paragraph).

<!-- Example of another paragraph -->
What this paragraph shows is that no metter how much i would try o extend/break that line the Markdown will keep text all in line "14".
<!-- Example of bold -->
This is **bold** text  
This is also __bold__ text

<!-- Example of italic  -->
This is _italic_ / _kursywy_

# Links and images
## Links


<!-- Example of external link -->

[Take a break...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

<!-- Example of link to another file -->

[and then go back to where we started](Empty.md)

Both links to external and internal files are added as follows: square bracket is text and than rounded bracket is the link/file

## Images

<!-- Example of an image from local file -->

![It is what it is](./Images/was-that-so-6572b19243.jpeg "memes")

It's important to add exclamation point before bracket so the image shows in text. The quote mark gives you possibility to add hover text.
